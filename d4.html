                <p>This accessibility team is loaded with talent. The man who designed Stephen Hawking’s chair? They got him. The man who created closed captions? They got him. The man who led the product team for the iMac and iPad? Oh, they got him too. Today I learned a ton about accessibility and myself. I got a better sense of what an accessibility team does. I compare it to a testing team in engineering. From what I gathered, it’s about an 80/20 split between making sure products are accessible to innovating new accessible solutions. Similar to Google, we went around to different stations that taught us different things to consider about accessibility. After lunch and a presentation on captions, I was fortunate to sit down with Mike Shebanek who was happy to answer some questions I had about marketing myself given my background in Mechanical Engineering. The talk was super helpful. I learned I’m more of an inventor. Mike advised me to consider finding a company I’d like to work at, find an area I could fill, and propose a position. It was a relief to hear that this is possible since I haven’t really felt connected to generic job postings in UX thus far.</p>

                <p>The feel of the Intuit office stuck with me. Something about it felt right. Although I’m not really interested in working at a purely software-oriented company, the vibe resonated with me. I appreciated the opportunity to network. Being able to talk with professionals informally made it easier to ask questions later in the week. I learned that it’s important to mention your hobbies on your resume from Larry. We connected over juggling because his roommate is a juggler and I’ve spent some time in a circus.</p>
