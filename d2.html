                    <p>I thought I was nervous to go to Alcatraz but that fear didn’t compare to the terror that was introductions. Thankfully, we didn’t have to give any formal introduction because Walmart had us do some improve activities instead. Nevertheless, my heart rate spiked to 158 when it was my turn to share my “superpower”. I got to meet my team today and we brainstormed ideas for our project. During our brainstorming session, I proposed to do a spark activity where you write down several ideas on post-it notes. However, I failed to consider that this activity was inaccessible to Venkatesh, a member of our team who is blind. I learned a valuable lesson to consider the accessibility and usability of my common practices in UX. Luckily we found a solution to write down our ideas on a Google Docs page. It would be great to create an accessible solution to spark activities in the future. After our team meeting, we went on a tour of the different buildings on Walmart’s campus. Our tour was interesting, but it really wasn’t focused on accessibility. After the tour, I really enjoyed the group activity we all did. We were tasked with redesigning a Capris Sun bottle to be more accessible. During the Q&A session, it became clear that Walmart is in the early stages of shifting their company culture to be driven by accessibility.</p>
