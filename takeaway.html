                        <span>Before & After</span>
                </div>
                <p>Before the trip, I thought of Silicon Valley as a fantasy land. I thought it was a place reserved for only the best designers and programmers. I didn’t feel like I had a chance of working there. The trip helped to bring my vision of Silicon Valley back down to reality. Now, working in Silicon Valley is actually a possibility for me. Out of all the companies we saw, I could see myself working at Google. The only thing I’m hesitant about is the cost of living. Food was extremely expensive in Silicon Valley. I’m not sure I could live comfortably on an entry-level salary in that area.</p>

                            <span>My career in UX</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>I fell in love with the accessibility teams during this trip. I learned that working in a field that’s committed to improving people’s lives is extremely important to me. With my background in Mechanical Engineering, I thought that my focus should be centered around finding a middle ground between ME and UX, but Mike Shebanek’s advice inspired me to stop thinking linearly about my career. Graduating this fall, I’m currently searching for a variety of roles in design that I think I would enjoy doing. I’ve opened the door to more opportunities. In the future, I can see myself working in accessibility with physical products, but for now, I’m going to focus on developing new skills and experience.</p>
