                <p>We went to the LinkedIn office to meet members of Microsoft's accessibility team. The highlight of the presentation was Seeing AI, which is the app we learned about and tinkered with at the Lighthouse for the Blind. I wish we had some time to talk about some of the problems with the app that were brought up during our activity working with blind and visually impaired students. Overall, it was an interesting demonstration. I can appreciate how the technology can empower individuals to become more independent in their daily lives.</p>

                <p>Apple… Oh, Apple. I basically lived in an Apple store when I was 13. Steve Jobs has been an idol of mine my whole life. I’ve read several books about his life, and I’ve owned almost every Apple product. When I heard we were going to the infinite loop, I was giddy with excitement. It’s always been a dream of mine to go. However, something about it didn’t feel right. Everything felt so bland. For a company that champions creativity, it didn’t feel like it when I was there. I was also a little bitter about not being allowed to take pictures. Also, the gift shop was extremely overpriced. I wasn’t surprised by this, but it’s worth mentioning. Unlike the other companies, we didn’t learn about what the accessibility team is currently working on. It felt more like a history lesson on how Apple’s OS paved the way for accessible touchscreen devices. After the presentations, we had the opportunity to network with MSU Alumnus where I met a guy who leads a sales division out of Seattle. We spoke for a while about native apps and web apps. This networking event taught me one important lesson: talk about what you know. In my Digital Rhetoric class last semester, I gave a presentation on the topic of native and web apps. This knowledge made me seem a lot smarter than I actually am. Talking about what I know when networking worked so well that I’ll probably continue using this strategy for the rest of my life.</p>
