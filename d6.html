                <p>Facebook was so awesome! The streets were apparently designed by the same person who designed Disneyland, so it feels like you’re walking down Mainstreet USA. Facebook had the most exciting, beautiful, and innovative campus I’ve ever seen. I was so impressed that I spent over $100 buying merchandise at the gift shop. Seriously, it blew me away! Unfortunately, my head was in a bit of a fog during the accessibility team’s presentation. My team’s presentation was all I could think of. Thankfully, our team was able to present first. We went up there, and crushed it! I really felt confident with my work, and I felt strong answering questions. During the intermission of presentations, Mike told me if our proposed solution to improve the lives of patients with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia was a working prototype, he would’ve put money down TODAY! With my work validated like that, I can’t help but feel more confident in my abilities in UX. I had the opportunity to talk with Mike again after the presentations, and he gave me some more valuable advice. He told me to stop thinking linearly about my career. All this time I’ve thought that the decisions I make out of college will be set in stone and would ultimately define my future. Now I understand that I am free to explore several different avenues to gather a variety of skills and experiences.</p>
