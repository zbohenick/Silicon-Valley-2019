                <p>My team worked on a solution to improve the lives of patients with Alzheimer’s and dementia. Our solution was an application that worked with smart home technology like Google Home. The two major highlights of the app were the adaptive delay and adaptive alerts features, which use AI to learn the habits of the patient. Adaptive delays and alerts will learn to help remind the patient to perform daily tasks when necessary. The app also provides the caretaker with a summary of the patient’s progress. Another major benefit of our solution was allowing caretakers to record reminders. Our research found that patients with Alzhemer’s and other forms of dementia respond well to familiar voices. In order to complete this project in a week, I took on a leadership role. I think I did a good job of simplifying our problem and allotting tasks appropriately. Personally, I designed the ui and ux of the app.</p>
