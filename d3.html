                    <p>Although it wasn’t quite like it’s depicted in the movie The Internship, Google was still pretty cool. The bikes were awesome, the cafeteria was awesome, but the gift shop was extremely overpriced. The UX team described their design process, and we learned about focusing on other senses with olive oil tasting. As a designer of physical products, I was inspired by the presentation. I’ve actually thought a lot about how much time and effort is put into making the sounds, smells, and physical feeling of a car. After lunch, I enjoyed moving around the room to play with the new accessible technologies Google is working on. I could really see myself fitting into this environment, especially since it’s clear they have teams working on creating physical products. From a T-rex to a dessert-themed Android playground, Google was just filled with a bunch of oddball inspiring things. At the end of the day, we had some time to work in our group where we finalized what our project would be and planned the next steps of researching more about the topic of Alzheimer’s and dementia.</p>
